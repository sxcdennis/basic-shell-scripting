# Loops

In this section we'll go over loops which consist of **for, while, until** and **do**. Loops are exactly what they sound like- repeating tasks x amount of times.

By now you should be able to understand how to execute scripts and do all scripting standards. I will not be including them from this point forward. If you still need help with that, I suggest you go back and read and practice them.

## do and done

*do* and *done* are exactly how they sound. *do* a set of commands then *done* ends the commands.

**Syntax:**

```
do
  command(s)
done

```

**Example:**

```



```

**Output:**


```



```


## for loops

The *for loop* will take each item in a *list* , assign that item as the value of the variable, execute the commands between *do* and *done* then go back to the top, grab the next item in the list and repeat over.

A *list*
If do is in the same line as for, there needs to be a semicolon(**:**) after the

*list*  is a series strings, separated by spaces

## while loops

*while* an expression is true, keep executing lines of code.

**syntax**

```
while [ <conditions here> ]
do
<commands>

done

```  

**Example:**

```



```

**Output:**


```



```

# until loops

Until loops are similar to while loops. The difference is, it will execute commands until the conditions are met.

**syntax**

```

until [ <conditions here> ]
do
<commands>
done

```

**Example:**

```



```

**Output:**


```



```
